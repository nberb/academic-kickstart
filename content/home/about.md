## Biography

My goal is to understand how we can combine emerging technologies (e.g. robotics, AI and neuroengineering) with society to design sociotechnical systems that support human flourishing. To approach this highly interdisciplinary challenge, I'm combining insights from systems science with humanistic philosophy and virtue ethics. The two practical fields that I'm most enthusiastic about are education (Bildung) and elderly care.
